//Noisy Narcissus - The Noise Behind the Mask - May 2020 - a prototype for Generative Media Coding course at Aalto University

//A reactive face tracking program that reacts and visualises different amplitudes of different frequency bands coming from microphone input

//this is part of the course Generative Media Coding 2020 at Aalto University taught by Matti Niinimäki and Nuno Correia

//this code uses parts of the code of a Facetracking example by Matti Niinimäki - https://github.com/Mnstri
//it also uses some of the code of FFT analysis visualisation by Nuno Correia
//https://github.com/nunocorreia

//it also uses code from the FFT-Audio In program by EDAP: https://github.com/edap/examplesOfxMaxim/tree/master/04-FFT-AudioIn

//the program uses some external addons such as ofxCV, ofxFacetracker, ofxGui, ofxMaxim and ofxOpenCv

//Made by Lu Priace Michavila - a.k.a Lucio Celomundo in May 2020
